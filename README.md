# Credit-Card-Fraud-detection
This is a credit card fraud detection project
The EDA does the exploratory data analysis on the dataset to gain some useful insights from the data
Then the dataset is loaded into a pandas dataframe and is preprocessed using "preprocessing.py" file before we feed it to our Random_forest_model
After that the the training and testing data is split and random_forest_model is trained with the training set and various hyperparameters are tuned using the accuracy that we achieve in the test set
in the "app.py" file
Surprisingly,We have achieved the acuuracy of 99.98% with this model
